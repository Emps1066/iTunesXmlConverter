Hello, this program will convert your Itunes XML Library folder and turn it into an SQL statement allowing you to put
your Itunes library data into an SQL database

To do this, place your xml library file into the XMLFiles folder, advised to only have one file in there at a time.
Then simply run the program and you will see a txt file has been created in the sqlInserts folder. All SQL statement
text files will be dated, so if you run it and want to find the newly created file, it will be the one with the most
recent time and date.

Thank you!

Some system information:

    UUID: If making use of UUID you will have to make sure you establish a BINARY PRIMARY KEY for your
    CREATE TABLE command within your SQL statement
